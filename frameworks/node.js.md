# Node.js

### \(NJ-100\) Approved Package Managers

Only the following Node.js package managers are approved for projects in Labs:

* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/)
  * Version &gt; 6.0.0

Rationale:

* Well executed package management is crucial to the realization of a stable and consistent Node-based product. Only mature and stable package managers are permitted on Labs projects.
* Yarn was recently removed given that npm has fixed many of the issues that Yarn had overcome.

Alternatives:

* None

Exceptions:

* None

### \(NJ-200\) Approved Testing Frameworks

Only the following Node.js testing frameworks are approved for projects in Labs:

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  * Version &gt; 25

Not permitted:

* Mocha, Jasmine

Rationale:

* While there are many valid ways to test a Node.js based application, we want limit the test frameworks in use so that we can maximize the opportunity for sharing of knowledge and tools.
* Jest provides a robust and well-supported feature set that allows it to perform many different tasks without requiring a lot of additional libraries.

Alternatives:

* None

Exceptions:

* None

Notes:

* This standard does _not_ exclude the use of various Jest plugins or compatible utility packages. For example, using SuperTest with Jest is perfectly acceptable as Jest is still the underlying test framework and SuperTest is simply an augmentation.

### \(NJ-300\) Always Commit Lock Files

Package manager lock files must _always_ be committed to source control:

* [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json)
* [yarn.lock](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/lockfiles-for-all/)

Rationale:

* The purpose of package manager lock files is to maintain consistency between environments \(developers, production, etc\). The only way this works is to try to ensure that lock files are distributed along with your code.

Alternatives:

* None

Exceptions:

* None
