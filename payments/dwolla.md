# Dwolla

## `.env`

Requirements:

* All repositories _must_ include a `.env` file in the root of the `main` branch. This file should include all of the items:

```
key
Secret

```

* You can obtain a Dwolla Sandbox API Key and Secret by signing up for a free [Dwolla Sandbox Account](https://accounts-sandbox.dwolla.com/login)

## `.gitignore`

Requirements:

* All repositories _must_ include a `.gitignore` file in the root of the `main` branch. This file should include all of the items:

```
.env

```

Rationale:

* Your .env file will contain sensitive information like your Dwolla key and secret, which should never be shared.

Exceptions:

* None

## Test Environment

Requirments:

* When working in Dwolla's test environment, students should only use fake data, this includes customer names. Below you will find a link of how to format this data:

[Creating a Customer](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/receive-money/create-a-customer#step-1a-create-the-customer)

[Adding a bank funding source](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/send-money/add-funding-source#step-2a-adding-a-bank-to-the-receive-only-user): Routing numbers must be 9 digits long, account numbers must be 4 - 17 digits long.

Rationale:

* Using real data in Dwolla's API while in the testing environment is highly discouraged. The functionality to delete certain data isnâ€™t supported as per the data retention guidelines that Dwolla is subject to within the United States. It is important to not use sensitive information while testing in the Sandbox.

Exceptions:

* None
