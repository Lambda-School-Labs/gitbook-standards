# Data Persistence

### \(DP-100\) Managed Services Only

Only fully managed storage services are to be used for hosting a database in a shared environment.

Rationale:

* Managing database servers is an incredibly complex and resource-intensive endeavor. By utilizing managed services, operational overhead is greatly reduced.

Exceptions:

* None

### \(DP-200\) Approved Database Engines

Only the following database engines are approved for projects in Labs:

| Engine | Permitted Versions | Providers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Postgres | &gt; 11.5.0 | AWS RDS |
|  | Heroku Postgres |  |

All other database engines are prohibited, including:

* MongoDB, DynamoDB, SQLite, MySQL, DB2

Rationale:

* We restrict database engine use in Lambda Labs so that we can focus our resources on a subset of available technologies. By narrowing the field of choices, we feel that product quality will be improved through the sharing of common knowledge and reusable components.

Exceptions:

* None
