# Git

### \(GT-100\) Only Branch from Master

All branches must be created from the `master` branch

Rationale:

* Multiple levels of branching from the `master` branch can create opportunities for merge conflicts

Exceptions:

* None

### \(GT-200\) Feature Branch Naming

Per GT-200, repositories should only contain a single `master` branch and zero or more feature branches.

Feature branches must be named: `feature/<descriptive name>`

For example, if you're working on a feature that allows users to change the email address in their profile, the branch should be named `feature/change-email`

Rationale:

* Without a good naming convention, it is very easy to lose track of the purpose of a branch

Exceptions:

* None

### \(GT-300\) Delete Merged Branches

After a branch has been merged to master, it must be immediately deleted.

Rationale:

* Short-lived branches are a best-practice for minimizing merge conflicts. Leaving many branches active in a repository makes it difficult for team members to navigate the ongoing work. Once a branch has been reviewed, approved, and merged into the `master` branch, it should be immediately deleted.
* A healthy Git repository has a minimum of active branches.
* This is [easy to comply with using GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches).

Exceptions:

* None
