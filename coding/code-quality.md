# Code Quality

### \(CQ-100\) High Maintainability

Requirements:

* All repositories _must_ maintain their `main` branch at a Code Climate maintainability score of B or above.
* This score _must_ be updated immediately after code is merged into the `main` branch.
* The maintainability score must be displayed near the top of the README at the root of the repository.

Rationale:

* Code Climate provides a robust and industry-standard measure for the maintainability of a codebase. While this is only one of many possible measures, Code Climate provides a solid baseline for measuring code quality.

Exceptions:

* The following types of repositories are excluded from this standard:
  * Data science repositories containing only Jupyter Notebooks
  * Static websites not containing any code
  * Repos containing only programming languages not supported by Code Climate
* The following types of code can be excluded from your maintainability score:
  * Test code
  * Data migration code
  * Generated code
* In addition to the above exclusions, the following filter settings may be used by all projects. Any additional filters require approval from an engineering manager.

  ```yaml
  # .codeclimate.yml
  version: "2"
  checks:
      # Disable checks for similar code.
      # Because this creates too many false positives.
      similar-code:
          enabled: false
      # Increase the number of lines allowed for a method.
      # Because this is more reasonable for JavaScript.
      method-lines:
          config:
              threshold: 50
  exclude_patterns:
      - "tests/"
      - "spec/"
      - "**/*.spec.js"
      - "**/*.spec.jsx"
      - "**/*.spec.ts"
      - "**/*.spec.tsx"
      - "**/vendor/"
      - "**/node_modules/"
  ```

### \(CQ-110\) Robust Test Coverage

Requirements:

* All repositories are required to maintain a code coverage level of 40% or higher for their `main` branch.
* Code coverage percentage _must_ be published whenever code is pushed into the `master` branch.
* The code coverage percentage must be displayed near the top of the README at the root of the repository.
* All application code _must_ be included in the coverage percentage, even if tests have yet to be written for the code.

Rationale:

* Code coverage is an indicator of how well test cases cover the codebase. While not a singular indicator of test quality, it is an important factor in ensuring that test cases cover a wide area of the codebase.

Exceptions:

* The following types of repositories are excluded from this standard:
  * Data science repositories containing only Jupyter Notebooks
  * Static websites not containing any code
* The following code can be excluded from your test coverage percentage:
  * Test code
  * Data migration code

### \(CQ-120\) Code Cleanliness

When code is no longer wanted, delete it. Never commit commented out code.

Pull requests should not be approved until these comments have been removed.

Rationale:

* Standard git usage already tracks removed code so that it's not lost.
* Leaving commented code leave the code base `littered` with distractions to the actual code flow.

Exceptions:

* None

### \(CQ-130\) Never Hardcode Data

Data is anything that could potentially change between runtime environments or over time during runtime.

This includes:

* URLs
* User data
  * Email addresses
  * Usernames
  * Addresses
* Identifiers for accessing external resources \(e.g. OAuth Client ID\)

Data must _always_ be stored in an external persistent store, like a database, or passed to the program as an environment variable. When in doubt, you probably should consider using a database or environment variable to pass data to a program.

Rationale:

* Data changes over time and if you hardcode it, you will need to redeploy your application to update the data. If you use a database or environment variable, you can change the data without requiring a new deployment.
* While hardcoded data may not qualify as a secret, it still may be considered sensitive. For example, a hardcoded email address can be easily discovered in GitHub and used to send spam or for phishing attacks.

Exceptions:

* None
